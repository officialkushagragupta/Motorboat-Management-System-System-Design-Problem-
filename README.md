# Motorboat-Management-System-System-Design-Problem-

The motorboat Industry is one of the most undermined industry that has driven maritime and coastal 
tourism to a whole new trajectory. Across the world, there has been an increase in demand for water 
activities that have become a major tourism attraction, especially in coastal areas. With the passing
time, a dynamic approach is the need of the hour. I have developed a Motorboat Project which aims 
to cater its online management system. I have made this innovative project in C language (which has 
survived more than 3 decades in an industry where newer languages, tools, and technologies emerge 
and vanish day in and day out) and not to mention its overpowering features.

My objective for this project was to achieve online automation which provides greater freedom and 
flexibility in this approach as it accords users greater choice and more avenues. Users and trainers 
enjoy flexible hours, choice, and the ability to enhance income by multiplying their engagement.

The approach I have followed throughout is realistic and dynamic at every level, providing the end 
user flexibility and accountability at business perspective. I rejoice to add the key feature of my model 
i.e., its clean assigning structure, which provides a clean UI (user interface) to facilitate online user 
registration, book slots, schedule for motorboats and instructors based on certain parameters as well 
as maintaining a healthy record of the same. Moreover, my model is applicable to various similar fields 
too, for example, tuition management systems, driving school management systems, Meeting 
Scheduler, gymnasium management systems, etc., and helps avoid any human error leading to 
overlapping timings for instructors as well as Motorboats.
